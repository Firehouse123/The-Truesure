<h1>The Lost Treasure of Eldoria</h1>

    <p>You are a young adventurer in the mystical land of Eldoria, known for its untold riches and hidden dangers. After hearing rumors of a legendary treasure hidden deep within the Forest of Shadows, you’ve decided to embark on a journey to find it.</p>
    <p>The morning sun barely peeks through the thick canopy as you stand at the edge of the forest. The path before you is overgrown and shrouded in mist, but the promise of untold wealth drives you forward.</p>
    <p>As you take your first steps into the forest, you hear a rustling in the bushes nearby.</p>
    <button onclick="investigateNoise()">Investigate the noise</button>

            <p>You decide to investigate the noise. Carefully, you push aside the thick undergrowth, moving closer to the source of the sound. As you part the last of the bushes, you find yourself face to face with a small, frightened creature. It's a fox, but not an ordinary one—its fur shimmers with a faint golden glow.</p>
            <p>The fox looks at you with intelligent eyes, almost as if it’s trying to communicate. Before you can react, the fox darts off deeper into the forest, pausing momentarily to look back at you, as if beckoning you to follow.</p>

            <p>You choose to continue on the path, leaving the noise behind. The forest grows darker and more foreboding with each step you take. Soon, you find yourself at a crossroads. The path splits into two directions.</p>
            <p>One path seems well-trodden, with sunlight filtering through the trees. The other path is overgrown, barely visible, and leads deeper into the darkness.</p>
            <button onclick="takeSunlitPath()">Take the sunlit path</button>

            <p>You draw your weapon and prepare to defend yourself, expecting danger at every turn. The rustling grows louder, but nothing emerges from the bushes. After a few tense moments, you realize it might have been just a small animal.</p>
            <p>With your nerves slightly on edge, you decide to continue down the path, more alert than before.</p>
            <button onclick="continueOn()">Continue on the path</button>

            <p>You decide to follow the fox, intrigued by its mysterious nature. The fox leads you deeper into the forest, darting through the trees with a grace that’s hard to match. You keep pace as best as you can, avoiding roots and low-hanging branches.</p>
            <p>After a few minutes of running, the fox suddenly stops in a small clearing. In the center of the clearing is an ancient, weathered stone altar covered in moss and strange carvings. The fox sits at the base of the altar, its glowing fur casting an eerie light on the stone.</p>
            <p>As you approach, you notice that the carvings on the altar seem to depict a story. There are images of adventurers, like yourself, seeking out a powerful artifact, but also warnings of the dangers that lie ahead. The fox watches you closely, as if waiting for you to understand something important.</p>

            <p>You decide to ignore the fox and continue on the path. The forest is full of distractions, but you keep your focus on your goal: finding the treasure of Eldoria.</p>
            <p>As you walk, the trees grow denser and the air becomes cooler. You sense that you’re getting closer to something, though you can’t tell if it’s the treasure or something else entirely.</p>

            <p>You decide to set a trap to catch the fox. Using your knowledge of the wilderness, you quickly gather materials and set up a simple snare.</p>
            <p>After a few moments, the fox cautiously returns to the clearing. It sniffs around the trap but seems to sense something is wrong. The fox looks at you, almost disappointed, before it turns and vanishes into the forest, leaving you alone at the altar.</p>
            <p>It seems you’ve lost the fox’s trust, but the altar is still here.</p>

            <p>You step closer to the altar and examine the carvings. They depict a tale of an ancient treasure, hidden away by the guardians of the forest. The carvings also show that those who seek the treasure must pass a series of trials, testing their courage, wisdom, and strength.</p>
            <p>At the base of the altar, you notice a small indentation in the shape of a fox. It seems something is meant to be placed here, but you’re not sure what.</p>

            <p>The amulet seems to radiate a faint warmth as you hold it. Perhaps this is the key to unlocking the altar’s secrets.</p>

            <p>You approach the fox cautiously, trying to communicate with it. The fox tilts its head, watching you closely. You sense that the fox is somehow connected to the altar and the treasure you seek.</p>
            <p>The fox seems to trust you, and it nudges your hand with its nose. You notice that the fox’s fur is glowing more brightly now, and its eyes seem to urge you toward the altar.</p>

            <p>The altar slowly shifts, revealing a hidden staircase leading down into the earth. The fox gives you one last look, as if to say, "Good luck," before it vanishes into the trees.</p>
            <p>You have unlocked a secret passage. Will you venture into the depths to discover the treasure?</p>

At the bottom, you find yourself in a vast underground chamber, filled with ancient treasures and artifacts. In the center of the chamber is a grand chest, decorated with the same fox emblem you saw on the altar.</p>
            <p>It looks like you’ve found the legendary treasure of Eldoria. Congratulations on completing your adventure!</p>

            <p>In the center of the chamber, you find a pedestal with an old chest on top. The chest is covered in strange symbols and seems to be locked. On the wall behind the pedestal, there is a mural depicting a puzzle involving moving stones to match symbols.</p>
